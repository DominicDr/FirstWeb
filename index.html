            My name is Dominic, i'm 21 years old. I'm studying management on Ignatianum Academy in Cracow
            and also I learn how to write a code, because I would like to become a developer one day. I love sports
            and computer games. Topic of my first site is Greek Mythology - one of the most interesting topic in my opinion. Cheers!
